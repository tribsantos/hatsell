GOAL
Add a new section called “Settings for this meeting” on the General Settings page.
Place it below the Organization Profile options and above the Confirm/Cancel buttons.
Move (or duplicate) the existing “Previous Notice Information” into this new meeting section,
and extend it with “Agenda items” plus a few other meeting-specific settings.

UI STRUCTURE (HIGH LEVEL)
1) Keep “Organization Profile” as the place for standing/default rules:
   - Total membership
   - Quorum
   - Voting basis for majority / two-thirds
   - Default debate limits
   - Default meeting format capabilities (if you want these as org-level defaults)

2) Create a new panel/section below it:
   Title: “Settings for this meeting”
   Description: “Items here are meeting-specific. Some may require adoption at the start of the meeting.”

3) Inside “Settings for this meeting”, include subsections in this order:
   A) Agenda items
   B) Previous notice (meeting notice flags)
   C) Meeting type constraints (Regular vs Special meeting)
   D) Electronic meeting procedures (only shown if meeting format is hybrid/electronic)
   E) Proposed opening package (optional but recommended)



AGENDA ITEMS 
Establishing an agenda is optional, but if the user decides to have one, each agenda item MUST have a category that determines the meeting flow and the rule set that applies.
Implement the agenda item category dropdown with (at minimum) these options:

- Informational / Report
  (Officer report, committee report, presentation, announcements; usually no immediate decision unless a motion is later made.) should allow debate later, but with a few differences. Instead of "Speak in Favor" and "Speak Against" it would say "Speak" for all. Priority rules still apply, though some will be moot.

- General business (Main motion)
  (Normal decisions; supports motion + debate + amendment + vote.)

- Rescind / Amend Something Previously Adopted
  (Used to change or undo something already adopted; thresholds depend on whether previous notice was given and other conditions.)

- Bylaw amendments
  (Distinct class; often has special notice and voting requirements.)

- Election
  (Distinct workflow: nominations, ballot rules, counting, majority/plurality per the org’s rules.)

- Formal disciplinary procedure
  (Distinct workflow; often stricter procedural safeguards and notice considerations.)

- Financial matters (Budget / Dues / Assessments)
  (Often governed by special org rules; benefits from being flagged distinctly so participants know expectations.)

Suggested AgendaItem fields:
- Title (required)
- Category (required, from the list above)
- Owner/Sponsor (optional; e.g., “Treasurer”, “Board Chair”)
- Optional time target (minutes) and notes

AGENDA STATUS (BINDING VS GUIDANCE)
Add an “Agenda status” control in the Agenda items subsection:
- “Agenda is guidance only”
- “Agenda will be adopted as Orders of the Day (binding)”

If the agenda is adopted as Orders of the Day, the app should enforce strict adherence.


PREVIOUS NOTICE UI (MOVE/DUPLICATE EXISTING)
1) Move the existing “Previous Notice Information” panel into “Settings for this meeting”.
2) Keep these checkboxes exactly:
   - Rescind / Amend Something Previously Adopted
   - Bylaw Amendments
   - Discharge a Committee
   - Formal disciplinary procedure
3) Store these values per meeting (not in org defaults).

Behavior note:
- These checkboxes are inputs to the app’s motion-validity / threshold logic.
- If a user initiates a notice-sensitive action but the notice flag is not set, the app should follow the stricter/no-notice path.

MEETING TYPE CONSTRAINTS
1) Add a subsection: “Meeting type”
2) Provide radio:
   - Regular meeting
   - Special meeting
3) If Special meeting selected:
   - Show a checkbox “Restrict business to items listed in the call/agenda”
   - Default this checkbox to ON

Behavior note:
- If Special + restriction is ON, limit available business to the agenda/call items.

ELECTRONIC MEETING RULES (CONDITIONAL)
1) Only render this subsection if meeting format is Hybrid or Electronic.
2) Fields:
   - Recognition method: Queue only / Chair / Hybrid
   - Chat policy: Informational only / Motions allowed
   - Raise hand mechanism: Button / Chat keyword
3) Persist these per meeting.

PROPOSED OPENING PACKAGE
Purpose: keep correctness by treating certain meeting-specific rules as proposed until adopted.
1) Add a subsection: “Proposed opening package (requires adoption)”
2) Checkbox: “Enable opening package”
3) If enabled, include checklist items:
   - Adopt agenda as Orders of the Day
   - Adopt electronic meeting rules (if applicable)
   - Adopt consent agenda (only if you implement it)
   - Adopt special debate limits (only if you implement per-item debate limits)

Behavior note:
- These settings should not be active until the meeting adopts them at the start.

MIGRATION / BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
- For meetings without MeetingSettings:
  - Default agenda status to “guidance only”
  - Default previousNotice flags to false
  - Default meetingType to Regular
