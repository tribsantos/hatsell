\- appeal chair is never available. To me it seems it should as a rule be available every time the last was taken by the chair.\- In that regard, the app should wait 5 seconds after each chair decision before it lets the chair move on in any form, so that people have a chance to appeal\- The chair should not be able to announce the results before everybody had a chance to vote, unless: 30 seconds have passed and the meeting has more than 10 members (strict sense, not chair, secretary, vice-chair) and the necessary majority (either negative or positive) has already been achieved; or after one minute, in which case the people who did not vote count as "abstentions".\- if someone has proposed a non-interrupting motion during the speech of another member, it correctly gets logged and queued for the chair to decide after the member has spoken. However, after the non-interrupting motion is logged, any other motion of equal or lower priority rank should be unclickable. For example, if an amendment will be proosed on the main motion and a third member also proposes an amendment on the main motion, the texts would branch out. If, however, a motion of higher priority is proposed during the same speech, then the first, lower priority motion remains unclickable (but recorded) until the higher priority motion is resolved, and then the chair will decide on the first motion, if the object still exists (that is, if, for example, the second motion presented during speech was "lay on the table", and the first had been an amendment, then there is no motion to amend).\- When members are given instruction to vote, the current presentation might lead inexperienced debaters to think that the original presentation of the motion is what is being voted on, instead of giving prominence to the original form. Right now it looks like this:Main Motionx \[as amended: y \[as amended: z]]I would like it to read:Main MotionzOriginal motion: "x"; First amendment: "y"; Second amendment: "z"\- On the log, after the result of the vote, I would like it to include what was the content voted on (only the final form of what was voted). So in the case that someone proposed x, it was proposed an amendment y, and it was proposed an amendment z, and both amendments passed, the log would read:13:36:33Vote on Main Motion: 3 ayes, 0 nays.

During a speech, other members can click and submit any motion that \*would\* be in order after the person has stopped speaking. When the member yields the floor, chair decides whether or not to recognize the motion. Going back to the situation when the person is speaking, a member has subimtted a motion that \*would\* be in order, and the member is still speaking. Now all the other members can only click at motions that would be in order if the still not recognized motion was recognized. One such motion is "lay on the table", but there are others.
